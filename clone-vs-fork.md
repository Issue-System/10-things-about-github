# Clone vs fork

Over time, you're going to end up with a lot of different repositories that you've either created yourself and maintain, or repositories that you and others collaborate on.

- If it’s not a repo you’re going to be a collaborator or maintainer for, go ahead and fork it.
- If you want to take the project in a different direction, fork it
