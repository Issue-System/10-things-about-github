# Cloning and forking

Over time, you're going to end up with a lot of different repositories that you've either created yourself and maintain, or repositories that you and others collaborate on.

## Forking

A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. A forked repository differs from a clone in that a connection exists between your fork and the original repository itself. In this way, your fork acts as a bridge between the original repository and your personal copy where you can contribute back to the original project using Pull Requests.

Forking a project is as easy as clicking the  Fork  button in the header of a repository. Once the process is complete, you’ll be taken right to your the forked copy of the project so you can start collaborating!

## Cloning

When you create a new repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote location where your project is stored. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer so that you can sync between both the local and remote locations of the project.

Unlike forking, you won’t be able to pull down changes from the original repository you cloned from, and if the project is owned by someone else you won’t be able to contribute back to it unless you are specifically invited as a collaborator. Cloning is ideal for instances when you need a way to quickly get your own copy of a repository where you may not be contributing to the original project.

To clone a repository, head over to the main page of a project and click the Clone or download button to get the the repository’s HTTPS or SSH URL. Then, you can perform the clone using the git clone command in your command line interface of choice.

## When to do what

- If it’s a repo you’re going to be a collaborator or maintainer for, but don't have write privileges, go ahead and fork it
- If you want to take the project in a different direction, fork it
- If you want to have a local copy of a repository you will work on with a team, clone it
- If it's a repository that allows you to run a program or generate something, clone it
- If you want a local copy of the repository, and don't need to sync it or have a connection back to the original repository, clone it
