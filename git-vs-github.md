# Git vs GitHub

I've noticed that folks mix up or are not clear on the differences between Git and GitHub. It's important to understand the differences between the two.

## Git

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.

## GitHub

Provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.
